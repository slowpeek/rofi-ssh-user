The script picks hosts from ssh config to show a rofi menu with named hosts to
connect to. It works similar to =rofi -show ssh= but instead of just =host= it
shows =user@host= list. With special commands embedded into the ssh config one
can customize the list.

* Commands

Commands are tailored for =Host= sections in the config. Command syntax:

#+begin_example
  ,#+ command arg1 arg2 ...
#+end_example

Available commands:

- hide :: Do not show this host in menu. The same effect can be achieved with
  =Match host ...= blocks in place of =Host= blocks, as with rofi.
- alt :: Alternative users to use with the host

Sample ssh config:

#+begin_example
  Host vm-focal.local vm-jammy.local
      User root
  ,#+  alt test

  Host laptop.local

  Host slowpeek.github
      Hostname github.com
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github/slowpeek_ed25519
  ,#+  hide
#+end_example

Generated list (in parsing order):

#+begin_example
  root@vm-focal.local
  test@vm-focal.local
  root@vm-jammy.local
  test@vm-jammy.local
  laptop.local
#+end_example

When passed to rofi the list is sorted by host first, user next.

* Usage

#+begin_example
  rofi-ssh-user [options] [-- [rofi options]]
#+end_example

Generic options:

- =-a=, =--align= :: Align menu items in two columns. Only meaningful for
  monospace fonts
- =-c=, =--config <config>= :: Use custom ssh config instead of default
  =~/.ssh/config=
- =-t=, =--terminal <terminal>= :: Use custom terminal app instead of default
  =x-terminal-emulator=. It can be either a path or a binary name available in
  =$PATH=

Special options:

- =-h, --help= :: Show usage
- =-q= :: Less verbose output: mute info messages
- =-qq= :: Less verbose output: mute info and warning messages
- =-s= :: Simulate mode: dump the command to be run instead of running it
- =-ss= :: Simulate mode: dump the list of hosts to be fed to rofi
- =-V, --version= :: Show version

Extra options after =--= are passed directly to rofi.

Default generic options and those tailored for rofi can be set in
=~/.config/rofi-ssh-user.defaults= with =options()= and =rofi_options()= arrays
in bash syntax. For example:

#+begin_example
  options=(
      -a
  )

  options_rofi=(
      -theme-str 'window { width: 16em; }'
      -theme-str 'listview { scrollbar: false; }'
      -no-fixed-num-lines
  )
#+end_example

The options are prepended to the ones provided explicitly.

* Installation

Clone the repo or unpack the zip into =/opt/=. Make the desktop file
discoverable:

#+begin_example
  sudo ln -s /opt/rofi-ssh-user/rofi-ssh-user.desktop /usr/share/applications
#+end_example

Tune the script's options in command line until you're satisfied. Now put those
options into =~/.config/rofi-ssh-user.defaults= as explained in [[#usage][Usage]].

Set some keyboard shortcut for =Rofi SSH user= application by means of your
desktop.

* Limitations

The script ignores such things in ssh config:

- patterns in =Host= sections
- =Match= sections
- =Include= keyword

* Troubleshooting

In case something wrong or nothing happens after an item got picked in the menu,
append =-s= option and run your command in terminal. It would show what it tried
to execute on picking the item.
