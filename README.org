This script is an alternative to =rofi -show ssh=. The key difference is it
lists /user@host/ instead of just /host/. With special commands embedded into
the ssh config, one can customize the list.

* Commands

Commands are tailored for =Host= sections in the config. Command syntax:

#+begin_example
  ,#+ command arg1 arg2 ...
#+end_example

Available commands:

- alt :: Alternative users to use with the host
- hide :: Do not show this host in menu. The same effect can be achieved with
  =Match host ...= blocks in place of =Host= blocks, as with rofi.

Sample ssh config:

#+begin_example
  Host vm-ubuntu.local vm-openbsd.local
      User vmuser
  ,#+  alt root

  Host laptop.local

  Host slowpeek.github
      Hostname github.com
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github/slowpeek_ed25519
  ,#+  hide
#+end_example

Generated list:

#+begin_example
  root@vm-ubuntu.local
  vmuser@vm-ubuntu.local
  root@vm-openbsd.local
  vmuser@vm-openbsd.local
  me@laptop.local
#+end_example

Domains are listed in the order of discovery. Users are sorted per domain.

* Usage

#+begin_example
  rofi-ssh-user [options] [-- [rofi options]]
#+end_example

Generic options:

- =-c=, =--config <config>= :: Use custom ssh config instead of default
  =~/.ssh/config=
- =-t=, =--terminal <terminal>= :: Use custom terminal app instead of default
  =x-terminal-emulator=. It can be either a path or a binary name available in
  =PATH=

Special options:

- =-h, --help= :: Show usage
- =-q= :: Less verbose output: mute info messages
- =-qq= :: Less verbose output: mute info and warning messages
- =-s= :: Simulate mode: dump the command to be run instead of running it
- =-ss= :: Simulate mode: dump the list of hosts to be fed to rofi
- =-V, --version= :: Show version

Extra options after =--= are passed directly to rofi.

Default generic options and those tailored for rofi can be set in
=~/.config/rofi-ssh-user.defaults= with =options()= and =rofi_options()= arrays
in bash syntax. For example:

#+begin_example
  options=(
      -t konsole
  )

  options_rofi=(
      -theme-str 'listview { scrollbar: false; }'
  )
#+end_example

The options are prepended to the ones provided explicitly.

* Installation

Clone the repo or unpack the zip into =/opt/=. Make the desktop file
discoverable:

#+begin_example
  sudo ln -s /opt/rofi-ssh-user/rofi-ssh-user.desktop /usr/share/applications
#+end_example

*Optionally*, tune the options in command line until you're satisfied and put
those options into =~/.config/rofi-ssh-user.defaults= as explained in [[#usage][Usage]].

Set some keyboard shortcut for =Rofi SSH user= application by means of your
desktop.

* Limitations

The script ignores such things in ssh config:

- patterns in =Host= sections
- =Match= sections
- =Include= keyword

* Troubleshooting

In case something wrong or nothing happens after an item got picked in the menu,
append =-s= option and run your command in terminal. It would show what it tried
to execute on picking the item.
